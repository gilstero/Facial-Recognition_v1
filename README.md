# Facial-Recognition_v1
This software was built using the Tensorflow and Keras libraries. The model is based on Vgg16 architecture and works using 100 images of my face. The top end is built using two Dense layers. 

The model is somewhat inefficient. Only 10 epochs were used in training because of hardware limits. This is version 1 of a more complex and longer project.
